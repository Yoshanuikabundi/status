OpenFF Maintainer Dashboard
===========================

This repostiory tracks the status of the core pieces of infrastructure built, mainted and used by the Open Force Field consortium.

See [STATUS.md](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff/blob/master/STATUS.md)

**Note:** *This repository was previously planned to be used as a 'metapackage' to facilitate importing all packages built by the consortium under a single umbrella. This is no longer the case as the built-in python namespaces will be used instead. The commit history for this repository as a 'metapackage' is stored at commit [3ada687](3ada68743104d49f7ee03c933fde6af3ce78d972)*.
